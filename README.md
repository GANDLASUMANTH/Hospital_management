# THOUGHT PROCESS:
Patient enters a hospital and takes an appointment. He/She waits for his turn and then gets treated by the doctor. Then, he/she is provided with a prescription. According to prescription, he/she pays the bill and completes their treatment. And if it is mentioned in prescription that he/she needs to get admitted, they become in-patients and they are also expected to pay the room bill. All the payment is done at bill-counter where patient gives his patient_id and gets the details of his payment.
